# Internal Process Quality and Control Standards

## Purpose
These standards define the minimum quality, control, and governance requirements for all operational processes within the company.

All process analyses, risk evaluations, and redesigns must be strictly aligned with these rules.

---

## 1. Process Structure Standards

### 1.1 Documentation
- Every process must have a documented SOP describing:
  - Purpose
  - Scope
  - Responsible roles
  - Inputs and outputs
  - Control points
- The SOP must be consistent with the BPMN flow.

### 1.2 BPMN Requirements
- BPMN flows must clearly define:
  - Start and end events
  - Decision points
  - Responsible roles per activity
  - Mandatory approvals
- Parallel or skipped activities must be explicitly justified.

---

## 2. Control Points

### 2.1 Mandatory Controls
- All processes involving financial impact must include:
  - At least one validation control
  - At least one approval control
- Controls must not be implicit or informal.

### 2.2 Approval Rules
- Financial approvals must follow segregation of duties:
  - The same role cannot create and approve a transaction.
- High-impact transactions must require multi-level approval.

---

## 3. Risk Classification

### 3.1 Risk Dimensions
Each process must be evaluated across:
- Financial impact
- Operational impact
- Probability of error
- Effectiveness of existing controls

### 3.2 Risk Levels
- Low Risk: minimal impact, strong controls
- Medium Risk: moderate impact or partial controls
- High Risk: high impact and/or weak or missing controls

---

## 4. Traceability and Auditability

### 4.1 Traceability
- All critical decisions must be traceable to:
  - A role
  - A timestamp
  - A justification
- Processes lacking traceability are considered non-compliant.

### 4.2 Evidence
- Each control point must produce evidence:
  - Approval record
  - System log
  - Documented confirmation

---

## 5. Continuous Improvement

### 5.1 Process Review
- Processes must be reviewed periodically when:
  - Risk level is high
  - Recurrent errors are detected
  - Regulations change

### 5.2 Redesign Principles
- Redesigns must prioritize:
  - Risk reduction
  - Control effectiveness
  - Operational simplicity
- Automation should be recommended where it reduces human error.

---

## 6. Enforcement
Any process that does not comply with these standards must be flagged, scored as higher risk, and recommended for redesign.
