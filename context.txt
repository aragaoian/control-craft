# Company Context — Foreign Trade & Logistics Company

## Company Overview
The company operates in the foreign trade and logistics sector, providing end-to-end services for international cargo movements. Its operations cover the entire lifecycle of an import and export transaction, from commercial agreement to final delivery.

The company acts as an integrator between clients, carriers, ports, customs authorities, financial institutions, and internal operational teams. Due to this position, process quality, control, and traceability are critical to avoid financial losses, regulatory penalties, and operational delays.

## Core Operational Areas
The company is structured into the following core areas:

- Commercial & Customer Operations
- Logistics & Freight Management
- Customs & Regulatory Compliance
- Financial Operations
- Risk & Process Governance

Each area is interdependent, meaning failures in one process often propagate downstream, amplifying operational and financial risk.

## Operational Characteristics
- High volume of transactions with low tolerance for errors
- Strict regulatory requirements imposed by customs authorities
- Financial exposure related to freight costs, taxes, fees, and penalties
- Time-sensitive operations where delays generate direct costs
- Strong reliance on documented processes (SOPs and BPMN flows)

## Risk Sensitivity
The company is particularly sensitive to:
- Incorrect classification of responsibilities (e.g. prepaid vs collect charges)
- Missing or weak approval controls
- Inconsistent execution of documented processes
- Lack of traceability for decisions and approvals
- Dependency on manual interventions

## Strategic Priorities
- Reduce operational and financial risk
- Increase process standardization
- Improve auditability and compliance
- Ensure processes are resilient to human error
- Enable continuous improvement through structured feedback

This context must be used to prioritize controls, risk classification, and improvement recommendations during process analysis.
